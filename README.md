# PyDash

A Geometry Dash–inspired Wave prototype built in Python with Pygame: one level, one gamemode, arcade movement, obstacles, and music sync. Originally made in 2023 as my first advanced Python project.

It currently features:
- 1 playable level
- Wave gamemode only
- music playback
- obstacle-based gameplay loop

> Not affiliated with or endorsed by Geometry Dash / RobTop Games. This is a fan-made learning project.
